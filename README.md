# Python-to-Java-Compiler
## ¿What is Compiler?
Compilers are used to create programs that are more efficient and faster than programs written in machine language directly. 
Additionally, they allow programmers to write programs in more readable and maintainable high-level languages, rather than having to work with machine code directly.

## Phases of a Compiler
-**Lexical analysis**: The compiler divides the source code into a series of tokens or symbols that represent keywords, identifiers, operators, and other elements of the programming language.

-**Syntactic analysis**: the compiler checks the structure of the source code and its conformity with the grammar of the programming language.

-**Semantic analysis**: It verifies that program instructions are semantically correct and consistent, and performs checks such as type assignment and name resolution.

-**Intermediate code generation**: This represents the program in a more abstract way and can be optimized before generating the object code.

-**Machine code generation**: Creates an executable block of machine code, as well as the necessary blocks intended to contain the data.

-**Phase of optimization**: The optimization can be carried out on the intermediate code (independently of the specific characteristics of the microprocessor), on the machine code, or on both, and it can be isolated from the previous two, or be integrated with them.

## Objetive
The objectives of this python to java compiler is that the python language can translate java code
