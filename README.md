## ¿What is Compiler?
Compilers are used to create programs that are more efficient and faster than programs written in machine language directly. 
Additionally, they allow programmers to write programs in more readable and maintainable high-level languages, rather than having to work with machine code directly.

## Phases of a Compiler
-lexical analysis: The compiler divides the source code into a series of tokens or symbols that represent keywords, identifiers, operators, and other elements of the programming language.
